      <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based
              hand rub.
        </li>
        <li>
        Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
        </li>
        <li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
            <li>
              Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when
              you cough or sneeze.
            </li>
            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
            <li>
              If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
              attention. Call in advance.
            </li>
            <li>Follow the directions of your local health authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Avoiding unneeded visits to medical facilities allows healthcare
            systems to operate more effectively, therefore protecting you and
            others.
